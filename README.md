42 Singapore Discovery Piscine — Python
This repository contains my Python exercises and solutions completed during 42 Singapore's Discover Piscine programme, held at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) campus.
About the Programme
The Discover Piscine is a short introductory bootcamp run by 42 Singapore that gives participants a hands-on taste of programming through Python. Like all 42 programmes, it follows a peer-to-peer, project-based learning approach — no teachers, no lectures, just you, your peers, and the exercises.
42 Singapore is part of the global 42 Network and operates in collaboration with SUTD.
Repository Structure
The exercises are organised into ten modules, each building on the last:

Language

Python — 100% of the codebase

How to Run
Make sure you have Python 3 installed, then run any exercise file directly:
bashpython3 <filename>.py
Disclaimer
These are my personal solutions written during the programme. If you are currently taking the Discover Piscine, try to work through the exercises on your own first — that is the 42 way.
