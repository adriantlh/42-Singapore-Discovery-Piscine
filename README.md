# 42 Singapore Discovery Piscine — Python

This repository contains my Python exercises and solutions completed during **42 Singapore's Discover Piscine** programme, held at the **Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)** campus.

## About the Programme

The **Discover Piscine** is a short introductory bootcamp run by [42 Singapore](https://www.42singapore.sg/) that gives participants a hands-on taste of programming through Python. Like all 42 programmes, it follows a peer-to-peer, project-based learning approach — no teachers, no lectures, just you, your peers, and the exercises.

42 Singapore is part of the global [42 Network](https://www.42network.org/) and operates in collaboration with SUTD.

## Repository Structure

The exercises are organised into ten modules, each building on the last:

| Module | Topic |
|--------|-------|
| `module0` | Introduction to Python basics and the terminal |
| `module1` | Variables and strings |
| `module2` | Conditional statements and loops |
| `module3` | Advanced loops and nested structures |
| `module4` | Functions and input/output handling |
| `module5` | Arrays and array functions |
| `module6` | Working with arrays (continued) |
| `module7` | Arrays and associated functions (continued) |
| `module8` | Methods and scopes |
| `module9` | Methods and scopes (continued) |

## Language

- **Python** — 100% of the codebase

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed, then run any exercise file directly:

```bash
python3 <filename>.py
```

## Disclaimer

These are my personal solutions written during the programme. If you are currently taking the Discover Piscine, try to work through the exercises on your own first — that is the 42 way.
