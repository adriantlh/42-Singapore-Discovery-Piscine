# 42 Singapore Discovery Piscine — Python

This repository contains my Python exercises and solutions completed during **42 Singapore's Discover Piscine** programme, held at the **Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)** campus.

## About the Programme

The **Discover Piscine** is a short introductory bootcamp run by [42 Singapore](https://www.42singapore.sg/) that gives participants a hands-on taste of programming through Python. Like all 42 programmes, it follows a peer-to-peer, project-based learning approach — no teachers, no lectures, just you, your peers, and the exercises.

42 Singapore is part of the global [42 Network](https://www.42network.org/) and operates in collaboration with SUTD.

## Repository Structure

The exercises are organised into ten modules, each building on the last:

| Module | Topic | Exercises |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| `module0` | Print statements and basic output | `42.py`, `hello_world.py` |
| `module1` | Variables, strings, and user input | `name.py`, `age.py`, `whatsyourname.py` |
| `module2` | Conditional statements (`if`/`elif`/`else`) | `iszero.py`, `isneg.py`, `password.py`, `mult.py` |
| `module3` | While loops and nested loops | `to25.py`, `multiplication_table.py`, `i_got_that.py`, `advanced_mult.py` |
| `module4` | String methods, math operations, and for loops | `upcase_it.py`, `age.py`, `calculator.py`, `float.py`, `round_up.py`, `up_low.py` |
| `module5` | Lists, sets, and command-line arguments | `create_array.py`, `play_with_arrays.py` (x3), `parameters.py` |
| `module6` | Command-line arguments and string manipulation | `aff_first_param.py`, `upcase_it.py`, `downcase_it.py`, `aff_rev_params.py`, `scan_it.py` |
| `module7` | String operations, slicing, and ranges | `parameter_matching.py`, `count_it.py`, `strings_are_arrays.py`, `append_it.py`, `free_range.py` |
| `module8` | Functions, return values, and scope | `hello_all.py`, `upcase_it.py`, `downcase_all.py`, `greetings_for_all.py`, `methods_everywhere.py`, `scope_that.py` |
| `module9` | Dictionaries (simple and nested) | `your_namebook.py`, `family_affairs.py`, `help_your_professor.py`, `persons_of_interest.py` |

## Language

- **Python** — 100% of the codebase

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed, then run any exercise file directly:

```bash
python3 <filename>.py
```

Some exercises in modules 5-8 accept command-line arguments:

```bash
python3 parameters.py arg1 arg2 arg3
```

## Disclaimer

These are my personal solutions written during the programme. If you are currently taking the Discover Piscine, try to work through the exercises on your own first — that is the 42 way.
