print (42)

# --- Improvement Recommendations ---
# 1. Add a shebang line at the top: #!/usr/bin/env python3
#    This allows the script to be run directly (e.g., ./42.py) without explicitly calling python3.
# 2. Remove the space before the parenthesis: print(42) instead of print (42).
#    PEP 8 (Python style guide) says not to put a space before the opening parenthesis of a function call.
