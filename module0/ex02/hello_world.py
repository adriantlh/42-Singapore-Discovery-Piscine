print ('Hello World')

# --- Improvement Recommendations ---
# 1. Add a shebang line at the top: #!/usr/bin/env python3
# 2. Remove the space before the parenthesis: print('Hello World') instead of print ('Hello World').
# 3. PEP 8 recommends consistency in quote style. Consider using double quotes "Hello World"
#    to match the convention used in the rest of your codebase.
