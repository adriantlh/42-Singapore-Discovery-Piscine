print (variable)

# --- Improvement Recommendations ---
# 1. Remove the space before parenthesis in print().
# 2. Add a blank line after the shebang line for readability.
# 3. Add spaces after commas in the list for PEP 8 compliance:
#    variable = [2, 8, 9, 48, 8, 22, -12, 2]
# 4. The variable name "variable" is very generic. Consider "numbers" or "data".
